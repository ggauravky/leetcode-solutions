# Table: Employee

# +-------------+------+
# | Column Name | Type |
# +-------------+------+
# | id          | int  |
# | salary      | int  |
# +-------------+------+
# id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
# Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
 

# Write a solution to find the second highest distinct salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).

# The result format is in the following example.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: 
# Employee table:
# +----+--------+
# | id | salary |
# +----+--------+
# | 1  | 100    |
# | 2  | 200    |
# | 3  | 300    |
# +----+--------+
# Output: 
# +---------------------+
# | SecondHighestSalary |
# +---------------------+
# | 200                 |
# +---------------------+
# Example 2:

# Input: 
# Employee table:
# +----+--------+
# | id | salary |
# +----+--------+
# | 1  | 100    |
# +----+--------+
# Output: 
# +---------------------+
# | SecondHighestSalary |
# +---------------------+
# | null                |
